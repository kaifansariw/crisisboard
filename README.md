CrisisBoard is a simple and powerful web app that helps college students submit complaints or issues to their college authorities — **anonymously or with their identity**. It makes sure that every complaint is sent to the right department and is also stored safely.
---

## 🔍 What This App Does

- Students log in using their **college email only**.
- They can submit any issue (like hygiene, food, bullying, etc.).
- If they want, they can **stay anonymous**.
- The issue is **automatically categorized** using **AI (Gemini API)**.
- The complaint is then **emailed to the correct authority**.
- Students can see all their past complaints in a simple list.
- They can also **delete** their complaints with a smooth animation.

---

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. **Login**: Only users with a valid college email can log in.
2. **Form**: Student writes their complaint and checks the "Anonymous" box if they don’t want to reveal their identity.
3. **AI Categorization**: The complaint is sent to a server where Gemini AI reads it and decides what kind of issue it is.
4. **Email Sending**: Based on the category, the complaint is sent to the correct department (like Security or Maintenance).
5. **Storage**: The complaint is saved in a database (Firestore).
6. **Your Dashboard**: You can see your past complaints and even delete them.
